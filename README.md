# pizza_cart_app
 A coding FE Challenge for adelphi

**Introduction**

This app was created for the adelphi FE coding challenge. It is a pizza ordering app that uses react as a frontend framework. 

**Demo**

[pizza cart](https://pizza-cart.proctor-webworks.com/)

**Plugins used**
* react-router-dom

**App Features**
* responsive design for desktop and mobile
* landing page to welcome user
* pizza order takes place in three steps (style, dough type, toppings)
* the user is show the state of their pizza
* user can select and unselect topings (cheese is by default selected
* a navigation bar shows the user the steps the user can go back to change order but not skip forward
* a total price is calculated as items are added to cart
* a vegitarian option can be selected and unselected
* order needs to be confirmed before accepted
* json appears in console once order is accepted

**App Structure**

The app is split into several different components. An index component as usual. An app component which renders all components and includes the data structure. A home component which includes the landing page, and order component that makes up the order pages, and a checkout component to create the checkout page. There is a nav component which includes the stepper and is included on the order and checkout pages. A pizza state component which shows the user their pizza (which toppings, what style etc.) which is included the in the order and checkout pages. There is also a card component which is loaded in the order pages. 

**App Improvements**

If I had more time here are the improvements I would make to the app: 
* Improve code by refactoring (especially the app component- where I would removed the data). 
* Add tests.
* Make design a bit more unique (right now just basic css and html)
* make components rely less on text and more on visual aids
* use the redux store (was not enough time to implement this)
